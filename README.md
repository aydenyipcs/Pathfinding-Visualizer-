# Pathfinding-Visualizer
This is Voyager, a pathfinding visualizer I built for my interest in algorithms. 
You can add and delete walls, set the animation speed and visualize different pathfinding and maze generation algorithms. 
This is still a work in-progress and will be launched very soon. Check out the video below or test it out by running - npm run dev.
